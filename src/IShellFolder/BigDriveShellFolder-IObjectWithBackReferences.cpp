//   This interface is used by the shell to manage back references for objects, but for most shell

/// Returns the number of back references currently held by this shell folder object.
/// The Windows Shell may call this method to determine if the folder object is referenced
/// by other components or objects, which can affect resource management and object lifetime.
/// 
/// In the context of a shell namespace extension, a "back reference" typically means another
/// object (such as a view, enumerator, or child item) is holding a reference to this folder.
/// If the count is nonzero, the shell may delay releasing or destroying the folder object to
/// avoid breaking those references.
/// 
/// This minimal implementation always returns 0, indicating that the folder does not track
/// or expose any back references. As a result, the shell will treat the object as having no
/// outstanding dependencies and may release it as soon as its own reference count drops to zero.
/// </summary>

/// Returning 0 is appropriate for most shell extensions that do not implement custom
/// back reference tracking. If your extension does manage such relationships, return
/// the actual count instead.
